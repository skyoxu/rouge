# Repo-level Codex configuration
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Codex loads `.codex/config.toml` AFTER `~/.codex/config.toml` and will override it.
# Keep this file empty (or comments-only) to avoid breaking developers' per-user MCP setup.
#
# Windows per-user config (recommended):
#   `C:\Users\<you>\.codex\config.toml`
